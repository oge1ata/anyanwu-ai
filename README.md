# ANYANWU — AI Coach

> A big sister. A coach. A system that doesn't let you off easy.

Anyanwu is a personal AI coaching app built to push you forward — not comfort you in place. She's direct, warm, and relentless about forward motion. Not a chatbot. Not a therapist. A big sister who's been through it and tells it straight.

Built and documented as a public series on Medium: [Part 1](https://medium.com/@yomacorp/️building-anyanwu-part-one-d53b445afb80) · [Part 2](https://medium.com/@yomacorp/️building-anyanwu-the-face-256cf4c7239a) · [Part 3](https://medium.com/@yomacorp/️-building-anyanwu-the-deployment-e0affa6da3e6)

## What It Does

- Coaches you through procrastination, fear of failure, and avoidance — without sugarcoating
- Sends a **5am wake-up** and **9pm check-in** every day
- Tracks what you've done daily so you have a record for job applications and presentations
- Remembers your conversation history across sessions
- Runs as a chat interface in the browser, built to become a full PWA
